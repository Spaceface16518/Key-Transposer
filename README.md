# Key Transposer

_Transpose musical notes into different keys_

Open the page, and read the instructions:

You should see two dropdown menus, one labeled **Key** and the other labeled as **Note**. Fill out one **Note** with the note you would like to transpose, then choose the **Key** you would like to transpose it into. Press **Submit**. The transposed note should pop up under the two dropdown menus.
