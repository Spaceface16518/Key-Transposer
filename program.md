1. A key is selected
2. A note is inputed
3. The submit button is pressed
4. The program takes the note and converts it into a number
5. The program takes that number and offsets it using a loop that resets at each octave
6. The program takes the newly offset number and converts it into a note
7. The program writes the new note onto the html page.
